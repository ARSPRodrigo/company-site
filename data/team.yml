#  * The short name should be identical to the image asset for the team member, located in 
#    source/images/team/<short name>.png.
#
#  * For the bio, include one or more paragraphs, each beginning with a - symbol. The quotes
#    around the paragraph's text are optional, but are encouraged as to avoid problems with
#    special characters (since as '). Line breaks in this file are ignored, but ensure that
