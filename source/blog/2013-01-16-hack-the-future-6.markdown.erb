[Hack the Future](http://hackthefuture.org) is a one-day party and hackathon for kids in grades 5-12.
It's a self-directed hackathon for future hackers. And, it’s a unique opportunity to learn modern
software and hardwaredesign and engineering from mentors in bay area startups and companies large
and small, like [Github](http://github.com) and [Microsoft](http://microsoft.com) (this year's
technical sponsors).

Last weekend, [Amoeba Consulting](http://amoe.ba) partners gave their time to ensure this all day
kid hackathon party was a success- from helping with event planning, and social media marketing, to
setting up ticketing systems, donation systems, and even designing this year’s t-shirt.

The event was held in the brand new tech studio, a “hands on” discovery area at the
[The Tech Museum of Innovation](http://www.thetech.org) in San Jose. The event brought together a
hundred kids with makers throughout Silicon Valley including programmers, game developers,
designers, web developers and engineers.

Amoeboid Daniel Jabbour led the web and javascript table- helping kids to get into programming. He
supplied them with some basic project starting points and let them discover for themselves what they
could accomplish with programming by designing their own blogs and games such as pong and chess.
Daniel commented, “for me, it was so fun to help a table full of kids write pong, in javascript, in
an afternoon... sitting a hundred feet away from the creator of Pong,
[Al Alcorn](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Allan_Alcorn) (another mentor at the event).”

Our designer Richard Enlow captained the design table, leading a team of design students from San
Jose State University through teaching kids design process- and helped inspire them to think like a
designer and get excited about their own creations. Throughout the day, they guided kids through the
design process, and helped with whatever they wanted to design- from defining the problems, thinking
about their users, coming up with design goals, ideating, sketching, to rapid prototyping for both
product and application designs.

Such a great day and we're happy to be a part of it.
