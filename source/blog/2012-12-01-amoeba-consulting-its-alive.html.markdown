After lots of planning, design, and coding, we finally are proud to launch the
[amoe.ba](http://amoe.ba "Amoeba Consulting") website, and with it Amoeba Consulting.
[Amoeba](http://amoe.ba "Amoeba Consulting") is a project born out of a group of friends who are
passionate about building great things. And we're super excited to finally announce our doors are
open.

[Amoe.ba](http://amoe.ba "Amoeba Consulting") is different from other consulting firms. We are
focused on helping bring new projects to life, to venture into the untested waters and figure out
how to sail. Our team has done it before: we've built successful apps in use by millions of users
around the world. From that experience, we've found that the most fun part of writing software is in
that very process- in creating new things.

On this blog, we hope to share our experience in engineering and design. I encourage you to sign up
for our various social channels to stay up to date on our latest news and information. And I hope
you find the information we post useful. We encourage you to engage with us, ask questions, give us
feedback, or just say "hi." We're here to help!

Welcome.

Daniel
