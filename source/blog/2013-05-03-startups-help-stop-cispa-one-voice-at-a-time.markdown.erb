CISPA, the bill that threatened to end online privacy, was essentially defeated last week. Supported
by corporate giants like AT&T, IBM, Intel, and Oracle, the opposition was almost entirely
grassroots, and its defeat can be attributed in some part to a tool called
[CISPApetition.org](http://www.cispapetition.org). Because we believe in a free and open internet,
we partnered with Change.org and Twilio to create [CISPApetition.org](http://www.cispapetition.org),
the first tool that enabled anyone to sign a petition and call or tweet their representative
directly. Within a matter of days the petition grew to the largest on the issue, with over 180,000
signatures.

## CISPA’s defeat

This past week, CISPA stalled in the Senate, which represents a huge victory for the American people
and anyone concerned with the future of online privacy. For those of you not familiar, CISPA stands
for the Cyber Intelligence Sharing and Protection Act a Bill. It was introduced last spring and
allows the government to seize private information on citizens from tech companies such as Google,
Facebook or Twitter without the need for a warrant.

Even Barack Obama and the White House expressed their fundamental concerns and threatened a veto
should it pass. Our site surpassed the White House's [own petition](https://petitions.whitehouse.gov/petition/stop-cispa-cyber-intelligence-sharing-and-protection-act/19sQhBpy),
which prompted the administration to take notice.

## Creating the CISPA Petition, generating 180,000+ signatures

After it went live, the tool was mentioned in the LA Times, Forbes, and various blogs including
[Twilio’s](http://www.twilio.com/blog/2013/04/daniel-jabbour-fights-cispa-with-twilio-api-and-change-org.html),
and went viral across social media networks, resulting in a huge surge of signatures and calls to
Congress representatives.

Creating a tool that enables phone and twitter connectivity and a petition platform would have never
been possible over a weekend were it not for the tremendous amount of APIs and open source tools
available on the internet today. Even after we released the site, several national non-profits reach
out to us from DC expressing interest in white labeling the tool for their own initiatives.

“The bill has stirred a tremendous amount of grassroots activism because it carves a loophole in all
known privacy laws and grants legal immunity for companies to share your private information,”
explains the Electronic Frontier Foundation’s [CISPA FAQ](https://www.eff.org/cybersecurity-bill-faq).

## A big win for privacy

A special thanks for Forbes, LA Times, and all the bloggers for covering the site we built and
especially the brilliant work done at Change.org and Twillio. A shout out also goes to Dev Bootcamp
student [Shivam Daryanani](https://twitter.com/shivamd) and software engineer
[Gabe Sanchez](https://twitter.com/mrgabesanchez) who helped pull the tool together over a weekend.
The [Sunlight Foundation](http://sunlightfoundation.com) also helped support the efforts with their
API, which provides the congressional data. Together we generated over 180,000+ signatures and
helped fuel a tidal wave of support in opposition to this bill.

We need to put the burden of information request on the government and stop making it trivial for
them to obtain, store, and mine your data. Violating someone's privacy should be considered a grave
injustice and while most citizens agree with this, often times these bills are misunderstood or
totally ignored which is a great disservice for our future.
